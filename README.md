# NetPbImages
small application that reads in net pb images(p1,p2,p3) and transforms them

challenge was to use as little "if"- statements as possible
when i wrote this i didn't use streams and lambdas a lot, so maybe this could be refactored with functional programming.

java -jar pbm-tools sample/sample_p1.pbm -rotate -invert sample/out_p1.pbm
